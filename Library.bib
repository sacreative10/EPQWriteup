  abstract = {Floating-point numbers have an intuitive meaning when it comes to physics-based numerical computations, and they have thus become the most common way of approximating real numbers in computers. The IEEE-754 Standard has played a large part in making floating-point arithmetic ubiquitous today, by specifying its semantics in a strict yet useful way as early as 1985. In particular, floating-point operations should be performed as if their results were first computed with an infinite precision and then rounded to the target format. A consequence is that floating-point arithmetic satisfies the ‘standard model’ that is often used for analysing the accuracy of floating-point algorithms. But that is only scraping the surface, and floating-point arithmetic offers much more.             In this survey we recall the history of floating-point arithmetic as well as its specification mandated by the IEEE-754 Standard. We also recall what properties it entails and what every programmer should know when designing a floating-point algorithm. We provide various basic blocks that can be implemented with floating-point arithmetic. In particular, one can actually compute the rounding error caused by some floating-point operations, which paves the way to designing more accurate algorithms. More generally, properties of floating-point arithmetic make it possible to extend the accuracy of computations beyond working precision.},

  abstract = {This paper explores the consequences of Wyszecki's hypothesis concerning metameric stimuli, that any radiometric function (column matrix N) comprises two components -- a fundamental metamer (column matrix N*) and a metameric black (column matrix B); N*=N-B. The fundamental metamer is unique and identical for all radiometric functions in a metameric suite. The metameric black has tristimulus values of 0, 0, 0 with all functions in color space and is different for each radiometric function in a metameric suite. Matrix R, derived by Cohen and Kappauf in 1982, is equal to A(A′ A)-1A′, where A is any matrix of color mixture functions. Premultiplication of matrix N by matrix R "kicks out" the metameric black, leaving the fundamental metamer, and thus mathematically simulates the color-processing mechanism of the visual system; RN=N*. Given any matrix A, the fundamental metamers of the primaries generating matrix A may be derived from the color mixture functions in matrix A. The paper proves and demonstrates that tristimulus values (rows of matrix A) are dimensionless weights on the fundamental metamers of the primaries (columns of matrix E). A given color mixture function does not invariably weight the same fundamental metamer, but depends on the entire triplet of primaries. The paper develops an invariant fundamental metamer space, governed by the theorems of Euclidean geometry, where every fundamental metamer has two representations: (a) a unique, invariant vector -- the vector fundamental metamer and (b) the locus of scalar products between the vector fundamental metamer (for the color stimulus) and all vector fundamental metamers representing monochromatic stimuli spanning the visible spectrum -- which is the invariant scalar fundamental metamer as originally conceived by Wyszecki. Two systems of color specification (other than tristimulus values) are disclosed. Strategic observation locates three orthogonal fundamental metamers of monochromatic stimuli. Various theoretical properties of the fundamental metamer space are developed. Several applications are discussed. The research on which this paper is based was conducted by Jozef B. Cohen and William E. Kappauf. Professor Kappauf died on October 2, 1983; the present paper was written by Professor Cohen.},

  abstract = {Most studies of pattern formation place particular emphasis on its role in the development of complex multicellular body plans. In simpler organisms, however, pattern formation is intrinsic to growth and behavior. Inspired by one such organism, the true slime mold Physarum polycephalum, we present examples of complex emergent pattern formation and evolution formed by a population of simple particle-like agents. Using simple local behaviors based on Chemotaxis, the mobile agent population spontaneously forms complex and dynamic transport networks. By adjusting simple model parameters, maps of characteristic patterning are obtained. Certain areas of the parameter mapping yield particularly complex long term behaviors, including the circular contraction of network lacunae and bifurcation of network paths to maintain network connectivity. We demonstrate the formation of irregular spots and labyrinthine and reticulated patterns by chemoattraction. Other Turing-like patterning schemes were obtained by using chemorepulsion behaviors, including the self-organization of regular periodic arrays of spots, and striped patterns. We show that complex pattern types can be produced without resorting to the hierarchical coupling of reaction-diffusion mechanisms. We also present network behaviors arising from simple pre-patterning cues, giving simple examples of how the emergent pattern formation processes evolve into networks with functional and quasi-physical properties including tensionlike effects, network minimization behavior, and repair to network damage. The results are interpreted in relation to classical theories of biological pattern formation in natural systems, and we suggest mechanisms by which emergent pattern formation processes may be used as a method for spatially represented unconventional computation. © 2010 Massachusetts Institute of Technology.},

  abstract = {Radiance Field methods have recently revolutionized novel-view synthesis of scenes captured with multiple photos or videos. However, achieving high visual quality still requires neural networks that are costly to train and render, while recent faster methods inevitably trade off speed for quality. For unbounded and complete scenes (rather than isolated objects) and 1080p resolution rendering, no current method can achieve real-time display rates. We introduce three key elements that allow us to achieve state-of-the-art visual quality while maintaining competitive training times and importantly allow high-quality real-time (≥ 30 fps) novel-view synthesis at 1080p resolution. First, starting from sparse points produced during camera calibration, we represent the scene with 3D Gaussians that preserve desirable properties of continuous volumetric radiance fields for scene optimization while avoiding unnecessary computation in empty space; Second, we perform interleaved optimization/density control of the 3D Gaussians, notably optimizing anisotropic covariance to achieve an accurate representation of the scene; Third, we develop a fast visibility-aware rendering algorithm that supports anisotropic splatting and both accelerates training and allows realtime rendering. We demonstrate state-of-the-art visual quality and real-time rendering on several established datasets.},

The simulated flock is an elaboration of a particle systems, with the simulated birds being the particles. The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is created by a distributed behavioral model much like that at work in a natural flock; the birds choose their own course. Each simulated bird is implemented as an independent actor that navigates according to its local perception of the dynamic environment, the laws of simulated physics that rule its motion, and a set of behaviors programmed into it by the "animator." The aggregate motion of the simulated flock is the result of the dense interaction of the relatively simple behaviors of the individual simulated birds.},

The core of the method lies in the use of visual top-view feedback from flying robots for the stabilization of the entire group in a leader–follower formation. We formulate a novel model predictive control-based methodology for guiding the formation. The method is employed to solve the trajectory planning and control of a virtual leader into a desired target region. In addition, the method is used for keeping the following vehicles in the desired shape of the group. The approach is designed to ensure direct visibility between aerial and ground vehicles, which is crucial for the formation stabilization using the hawk-eye-like approach. The presented system is verified in numerous experiments inspired by search-and-rescue applications, where the formation acts as a searching phalanx. In addition, stability and convergence analyses are provided to explicitly determine the limitations of the method in real-world applications.},

  abstract = {We propose a novel algorithm for ray/triangle intersection tests that, unlike most other such algorithms, is watertight at both edges and vertices for adjoining triangles, while also maintaining the same performance as simpler algorithms that are not watertight. Our algorithm is straightforward to implement, and is, in particular, robust for all triangle configurations including extreme cases, such as small and needle-like triangles. We achieve this robustness by transforming the intersection problem using a translation, shear, and scale transformation into a coordinate space where the ray starts at the origin and is directed, with unit length, along one coordinate axis. This simplifies the remaining intersection problem to a 2D problem where edge tests can be done conservatively using single-precision floating-point arithmetic. Using our algorithm, numerically challenging cases, where single precision is insufficient, can be detected with almost no overhead and can be accurately handled through a (rare) fallback to double precision. Because our algorithm is conservative but not exact, we must dynamically enlarge bounds during BVH traversal to conservatively bound the triangles intersected.},
